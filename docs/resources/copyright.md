**Copyright** is a collection of rights protected by the goverment that applies to original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. These rights ensure the copyright owner can decide who can copy the work. Yet this gets much more complicated.

Consider a world without copyright protection. You author a work (i.e. write a novel, compose a song, create an app), and someone wants to use it without your permission. Perhaps the sovereign emperor of the land likes your novel and decides to publish it for you, without including your name or paying you. Perhaps someone who hacks into your computer decides to share an app you were planning on selling with the world. Now, techincally you still have the work -- it was not stolen in the way a car or wallet is stolen. Your rights were infringed. Your agency was taken away from your work. Copyright is the set of laws that protect you in these situations.

### What Does Copyright Protect?

Copyright laws are rather complicated. It's best to seek legal advice when it comes to details. This is not legal advice. With that said, you can find information online that helps explain copyright protection as it pertains to your jurisdiction. For example this [page](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) lists rights protected by US copyright laws. For example, someone infringes your copyright if they copy your work to use it, modify it to make a derivative work, and/or distribute it, or the derived work without your consent.  

### What Does Copyright Not Protect?

That's even more complicated to address. There are a few carve-outs to note: Copyright does not protect ideas, processes, or concepts. You now see that source code, being protected by copyright, is viewed more as a literary work than a procedure. Copyright does not protect works that are trivial or too small for protection. e.g. No court will protect my claim that I authored the three word phrase "Roses are Red." Moreover, copyright protection excludes a category of infringment known as "fair use" where someone copies a small part of your work for use we consider socially acceptable (e.g. including an excerpt in a book review). 

### Copyright and Open Source

When developers want to share their code and get others to use it, modify it, and distribute it, they should make explicit that they are doing this by intent. Why? By default if you say nothging, anyone taking your code is infringing your copyright. You should tell them it's okay to use and under what conditions. You do that in a [license](../license.md). In a commercial transacion, someone pays you for license rights. In an open source project, you simply declare the license and now everyone will know they can use, modify, and redistribute your code under the license terms you specified. 

### Open Source as a Legal Construct

Open source means different things to different people. From a legal perspective, open source refers to work that is shared under a license that complies with the [open source definition](https://opensource.org/osd) as managed by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). The open source definition specifies what makes an open source license open. Simiarly, the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) manages the [free software definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) which specifies the "four freedoms" that are sought by the Free Software movement.  

There is considerable overlap between free software and open source, hence the merged acronym FOSS (or F/LOSS: adding _libre_ to remind people that the term _free_ in this context refers to freedoms, not to the absense of cost). There are sufficient differences between the two definitions that they will remain uncombined.
